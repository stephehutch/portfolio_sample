Dear Hiring Manager,
</p>
<p>
One of my strongest desires is to help nurture and care for children. When I saw the opening for Babysitter at Crane & Jenkins, it felt like the perfect opportunity and something I must pursue. I have been doing jobs in this capacity since I was young myself. Starting out as a camp counselor, I was responsible for watching groups of children ranging from 8 to 20 kids. Besides keeping them out of danger, I also created games and schedules for my groups to follow.
</p>
<p>
Though counselor work was just during summers, I branched off into babysitting during the school months. It turned out this was perfect for me. I began that “career” with just three different children under my watch on different days of the week. Through word of mouth and the barest of marketing strategies, I tripled my client list within three months of starting out.
</p>
<p>
That growth was thanks to a good neighborhood but also my skill and success at the job. Though babysitting doesn’t require as much activity as being a camp counselor, it is more focused on safety and care. Those are things that are vitally important to me. Keeping a child safe must be the main focus of a Babysitter.
</p>
<p>
At Crane & Jenkins, I know there is a new vibe compared to what I am used to. Rather than going to the child’s home, the child comes to us. That should work to my benefit as I grow comfortable with the environment. It will begin to feel like the child is coming to my home turf, which makes keeping them safe and happy even easier.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Nanny Jessica
